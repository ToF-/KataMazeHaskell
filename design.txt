1. read the maze specification from standard input
    # is a wall
    . is a free space
    A is starting point (on a border)
    B is ending point   (on a border)
2. transpose the maze into a graph
3. solve the maze: shortest path from A to B, using Djikstra Algorithm
4. outputs the maze solved 
    o is a step in the path
5. outputs the directions from A to B:
    e.g. EEESSWSSEEEEENNEE
